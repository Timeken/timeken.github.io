						<div class="content">
							<p>Hi I'm Tim Ekenberg<br>
							I have always loved creating things, whether it mods for games, archetypes for D&D or citys in Minecraft. I think the best part about creating things is to share it with others, to see them use or play something that you have made and enjoy it is the best feeling in the world. I want to create games and design experiences for people to enjoy, I have what it takes to make that happen. <br>
							I am a good problem solver, I am persistent, focused and have a lot of patience. I will not give up until I have solved the problem. I am also creative and have a good analytical ability.</p>
							
							<p>In my free time I like to play games with my friends, both digital and board / card games like D&D and Magic the Gathering. I also listen to alot of audio books mostly sci fi and fantasy.</p>
							
							<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!<br>
